# Replication Folder Template
---

These files help the creation of replication packages. Can be used as project folder from the start to help keep things organized. It is based on the [replication package](https://10.0.20.161/zenodo.14048457) for the paper ["Is Secessionism Mostly About Income or Identity? A Global Analysis of 3,153 Subnational Regions"]().
